Description: A stratified survey design method that selects sampling points in 
  a given territory using environmental and spatial distances as surrogates of 
  overall diversity. The procedure minimises the variation uncovered by the 
  selected points using a set of consecutive criteria repeated iteratively. In 
  each iteration, a p-median allocation criterion is used to define a vector of
  preselected sites, then a set of user defined conditions is applied to 
  restrict the preselected sites so that one location is selected in each 
  iteration.
